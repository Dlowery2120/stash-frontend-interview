# Hotel Search Page

## Overview
Stash Hotel Rewards equips independent hotels to fight back against the large chains by providing a loyalty points program, member rates, and other special perks for Stash members when they book direct or through the Stash booking engine.

## Objectives
To begin, please for this repository.

Data for this project can be found in data.json.

Create a new frontend application with at least three pages:
1. A hotels index page. You can use [our current hotels page](https://www.stashrewards.com/hotels) for inspiration. You can merely scaffold this page, as it is not the focus of the project, and you should not spend too much time on this page.
2. A hotel "microsite" page that displays information specific to an individual hotel. You can use [our current microsite page](https://www.stashrewards.com/hotel/seattle/the-state-hotel?search_guid=5a02b541-8282-41d3-bb7e-cf3e568814fa) for inspiration. You can merely scaffold this page, as it is not the focus of the project, and you should not spend too much time on this page.
3. A destination search results page for a searched city. You can use [our current destination search results page](https://www.stashrewards.com/travel/destination?adults=1&checkin=Tue+Jun+24+2025+00%3A00%3A00+GMT-0700+%28Pacific+Daylight+Time%29&checkout=Thu+Jun+26+2025+00%3A00%3A00+GMT-0700+%28Pacific+Daylight+Time%29&children=0&city_id=&hotel_id=&lat=47.6064&lng=-122.331&prev_view=Seattle%2C+Washington+State%2C+United+States&radius=3&search_value=Seattle%2C+Washington+State%2C+United+States&suppress_otas=true&view=destination) for inspiration. **This page will be the focus of the project**

The main portion of this project will be creating a search bar and designing a destination search results page for a selected city.

Each of these pages should display a search bar with the following inputs: "City or hotel name", "Checkin and Checkout", and "Travelers" including adults and children. When a user inputs data and navigates to a different page, the data that a user has entered into this search bar should persist. Our site currently supports this functionality and you can use it for inspiration.

For the city search results page, we are not asking you to recreate [our current search results page](https://www.stashrewards.com/travel/destination?adults=1&checkin=Tue+Jun+24+2025+00%3A00%3A00+GMT-0700+%28Pacific+Daylight+Time%29&checkout=Thu+Jun+26+2025+00%3A00%3A00+GMT-0700+%28Pacific+Daylight+Time%29&children=0&city_id=&hotel_id=&lat=47.6064&lng=-122.331&prev_view=Seattle%2C+Washington+State%2C+United+States&radius=3&search_value=Seattle%2C+Washington+State%2C+United+States&suppress_otas=true&view=destination) per se. Instead, we want to see you put your own spin on the page.

The following criteria will be evaluated:
- Project requirements are met.
- Project uses a modern javascript framework and incorporates helpful production-ready tools/libraries.
- Codebase demonstrates clean coding practices. Your code should be easy for other developers to read and work with.
- Styling is clean and modern and uses a framework that could be adopted by other developers
- Your project should demonstrate something unique that appeals to travelers.

Nice to haves:
- Codebase is tested and linted.
- Good frontend practices for SEO and accessibility are present.

Development is a collaborative process. So if you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
